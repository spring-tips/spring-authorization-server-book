# spring-authorization-server

Hi, Spring fans! In this installment we're going to look at some patterns and practices for working with the Spring Authorization Server


### to try it out 

* in the root, run `docker compose up`
* in the `authorization-service`, run `run.sh`
* in the `gateway`, run `run.sh`
* in the `api`, run `run.sh`
* in the `processor`, run `run.sh`
* in the `static`, run `run.sh`
* visit `http://127.0.0.1:8082` (not `localhost`!) in the browser.
* login with `jlong`/`password`, and then consent when prompted.
* click on the `email` button to kick off work in the `processor`
