{author} loves the Spring Authorization Server, and want you to love it too. Let's dive right into it.

== Introducing the Spring Authorization Server

Hi, Spring fans! In this installment we're going to look at some patterns and practices for working with the Spring Authorization Server, and with OAuth in general in a Spring Boot-based system. 

The Spring Authorization Server is one of my favorite new projects. It's a full blown OAuth identity provider (IDP), distributed as Spring Boot autoconfiguration.

The Spring Authorization Server is the final piece in the Spring Security OAuth's Ship of Theseus, the final replacement for a component in the built-in OAuth support in Spring Security 5 and later. First there was OIDC client support, and then resource server support, and now - after a _lot_ of community outpouring and support  - a brand new and fully featured OAuth IDP. 

Why not use Keycloak or Okta or Auth0, I hear you ask?  And the answer is.. be our guest! 99% of the stuff we're going to look at here works with any OAuth IDP. But i do so love the Spring Authorization Server. I don't know an easier way to get as configurable and flexible IDP up-and-running. 

Having an easy component for your IDP integration is _liberating_. If nothign else, it's one less `users` microservice for you to build. But, at its best, its a unifying force for your organization's notions of identity and policy, all centralized. If you implement it correctly, it's one less `users` microservice for _all_ of your systems, not just the one you're working on now! 

It's Spring, so it of course supports the new-and-novel, but it's also built like all Spring Boot autoconfiguration, with hooks and customization in mind at every step.  

I love it and I love it for helping me to love OAuth. If you only knew the agony I've been subjhected to in learing and weilding OAuth over the years, then you'll know what a thing that is for me to say.

And I want you, dear reader, to love OAuth. And the way to do that is to, basically, not care about OAuth. And so we're going to take a journey to production together, with the Spring Authorization Server at our backs, and learn how to weild OAuth (via the amazing Spring Authorization Server) for some common kinds of patterns.


== Try it out!

Now, before we go too far, try it out! 

* in root, run `docker compose up`
* in `authorization-service`, run `run.sh`
* in `gateway`, run `run.sh`
* in `api`, run `run.sh`
* in `processor`, run `run.sh`
* in `static`, run `run.sh`
* visit `http://127.0.0.1:8082` (important: use the IP, _not_ `localhost`!) in the browser.
* login with `jlong`/`password` (yes, I know it's a terrible password, don't `@` me!), and then consent when prompted.
* you'll see a list of customers, click on the `email` button to kick off work in the `processor`. You should see indications in the console that your message has been sent.

Lot's of moving parts, but here's what you need to know: we have a JavaScript/HTML 5 client, a backend HTTP API, and a headless backoffice process, all of which have been secured with the Spring Authorization Server.

Refreshingly simple. Let's dive right into the nitty gritty. I want you building secure systems by the article's end. My goal here is not to cover _every_ possible use case, but to cover some of the typical usecases and introduce progressively more moving parts so that, if at some point you don't see what you need, you know where to reach you to build it yourself. Let's dive right into it!

== Stand up a Spring Authorization Server Instance for Great Good


This part's as easy as possible.

Go to the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initialzr (start.spring.io)], specify a group ID and an artifact ID (I chose `bootiful`:`authorization-server`) and add  `OAuth2 Authorization Server` as a dependency. I'd add `GraalVM Native Support` for good measure, but you do you. Open the downloaded project in your IDE. I'm using IntelliJ IDEA, but again, you do you. I ran the following command from the root of the newly unzipped archive: `idea build.gradle`.

You've got a new Spring Boot Authorization Server. We need to specify two things: *users*, and *clients*.


=== Users

Users are pretty straight forward, right? A user is the sum of the username, password, and associated identity  information that is the beating heart of our endeavours. We plug those in in the usual ways, with implementations of Spring Security's `UserDetailsService`. You could implement your own (but I don't recommend it). Here's an example:

[code,java]
----
include::./authorization-server/src/main/java/bootiful/authorizationserver/DumbestUserDetailsService.java[]
----

You'd define an instance of it like this:

[code,java]
----
include::./authorization-server/snippets/DumbestUserDetailsServiceConfiguration.java[]
----


But, as the name makes so very clear, this is _dumb_. This doesn't handle encrypting the passwords, it's not particularly useful if you've already got an LDAP directory somewhere, etc. There are better ways. And even if all you want to do for the purposes of this example is just to define some users in-memory, there are still better ways, like the `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`, which we'll use instead.

[code,java]
----
include::./authorization-server/src/main/java/bootiful/authorizationserver/AuthorizationServerApplication.java[]
----

We've got two users:

* `jlong` with password `password` and roles `USER`
* `rwinch` with password `p@ssw0rd` and roles `USER` and `ADMIN`

=== OAuth Clients

Clients, on the other hand, define how a program or process interacts with the OAuth IDP (like Spring Authorization Server). Clients correspond more or less to the programs that would like to be allowed to authenticate on behalf of users.

I have tried a number of ways to conceive a clear explanation of clients in a vaacuum, but it's not ewasy. so lets examine a real life example: you stumble upon some website, say Yelp[https://www.yelp.com/], a website that lets you contribute and read reviews about locations - restaurants, businesses, tourist spots, etc. You want to login to see your history. You _could_ create a new account there, going through the whole sign up flow and entering redundant information, but this information could soon become stale. Maybe you change house or email address, or whatever, and you've forgotten to go back to the site and change your information. Yelp know this, so they offer another path forward: `Continue with Google` and `Continue with Apple`.

Click the button and another window on Google or Apple's sites pop up.

image::images/google-signin.png[]

You know what to do here: you're in familiar terriroty. It's google.com! You've got an account here, you maintain that account, and you like that account. You use it for your daily email, after all. You've even got that reassuring little padlock icon in the browser's location bar giving you the warm-n-fuzzies about this site. So you enter your information, login


So, if you built a backoffice process, you'd register a client for that backoffice process. If you built a new web application that you intend to suppoort automatic signin with OAuth, you'd register a new client for that web application. Clients are associated with a number of things related to how the user will eventually interact with the OAuth protocol: the client ID, and client secret, what types of authentication methods are supported, whether the user should be prompoted with a consent form, what rights each new user that is authenticated should have, and what - in the case of an HTTP client - URI the user should be redirected back to.
